# a__dictionaryFinder

Searching if elements from a file, exists in another one.

By this I mean that the user can search from a given file (txt, word, pdf etc) if its words are included in a dictionary.
This dictionary is a manual one. User can add whatever words he want inside the dictionary file.

Also this script made to help engineers to count the flexibility and the maintenace of vast code samples.
For example:

Let's say that a company on Monday had a file, file_1, with 10.000 lines of code. And that the next day the delevopers added 500 more.
If they will see that hey have a bug or an error after the added code, they can create two files (old code file, new code file) and compare them to see what they added. As a result, they can conclude which part of their code was responsible for this issue.

This is really usefule for vast code lines and complexity code implementations.

Purpose: help engineers (and developers) to testify their codes-samples

Target: to find the differences between the two code files

Program. Lang: C

Packages: stdio.h, stdilb.h, string.h, ctype
